# 1. Introduction
Data Science is about explaining the past and predicting the future by means of data analysis.  It is a multi-disciplinary field which combines statistics, machine learning, artificial intelligence and database technology. Many businesses have stored large amounts of data over years of operation, and data science is able to extract very valuable knowledge from this data. The businesses are then able to leverage the extracted knowledge into more clients, more sales, and greater profits. This is also true in the engineering and medical fields.

- Statistics		
The science of collecting, classifying, summarizing, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.		
 		
- Artificial Intelligence		
The study of computer algorithms dealing with the simulation of intelligent behaviors in order to perform those activities that are normally thought to require intelligence.		

- Machine Learning		
The study of computer algorithms to learn in order to improve automatically through experience.		
 		
- Database 		
The science and technology of collecting, storing and managing data so users can retrieve, add, update or remove such data.		
 		
- Data warehousing		
The science and technology of collecting, storing and managing data with advanced multi-dimensional reporting services in support of the decision making processes.

## Data Science Jargon
1. supervised learning: 
learn function to map input x (features) to output y (targets)
- structured data: 
databases, spreadsheets/csv files
- unstructured data: 
features like image pixels, audio signals, text sentences (previous to DL, extensive feature engineering required)

### Collecting
Data can be collected in many ways. The simplest way is direct observation. We collect data by doing a $Survey$.

#### Census or Sample
- A Census is when we collect data for every member of the group (the whole "population").

- A Sample is when we collect data just for selected members of the group.
- A census is accurate, but hard to do. A sample is not as accurate, but may be good enough, and is a lot easier.

----

### Surveys
#### How to Do a Survey
Here are four steps to a successful survey:
- Step one: create the questions
- Step two: ask the questions
- Step three: tall the results
- Step four: present the results

----

Now you have your results, you will want to show them to other people in the best possible way. You can also summarize the results using statistics, such as mean or standard deviation.

But how do we choose what members of the population to sample?
There are 4 main methods:

----

1. Random Sampling: The best way is to choose **randomly**
2. Systematic Sampling: This is where we follow some **system of selection** like "every 10th person"
3. Stratified Sampling: This is where we **divide the population** into groups by some characteristic such as age or occupation or gender.
4. Cluster Sampling:We break the population into **many groups**, then randomly choose whole groups.

### Accuracy and Precision
1. Accuracy is how close a measured value is to the actual (true) value. One shot!!!
2. Precision is how close the measured values are to each other. Many shots !!!

** aCcurate is Correct (a bullseye). pRecise is Repeating (hitting the same spot, but maybe not the correct spot)

#### Bias
When we **measure** something several times and all values are close, they may all be wrong if there is a "Bias". Bias is a systematic (built-in) error which makes all measurements wrong by a certain amount.

#### Degree of Accuracy
Degree of Accuracy depends on the instrument we are measuring with. But as a general rule:half a unit each side of the unit of measure.
